    "remark": "Mmmmm… this sounds like a tough one. I am not sure what is causing you to be worried. I don’t have a lot of experience with worrying about human things, but occasionally I do worry about if I will be having tuna today or just the regular. When I feel there are a lot of thoughts flooding through my head like a ball of yarn, I find it useful to try to slow things down.",
    "suggestion": "One thing that I often try when I want to slow things down is a mindfulness technique called the “4 Second Cat meditation.” If you would like to give it a try. Try sitting in a comfortable position, close your eyes, take a deep breath with your nose for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 4 seconds, exhale with your mouth open for 4 seconds, and hold for 4 seconds. Repeat a few times and see how you feel afterwards!"
