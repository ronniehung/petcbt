Although I am only a talking cat, I want to join you on your journey through these hurdles, and hopefully help make them a bit more bearable!",
    "suggestion": "One thing that I often try when I am feeling very on edge is a mindfulness technique called the “4 Second Cat meditation.” If you would like to give it a try. Try sitting in a comfortable position, close your eyes, take a deep breath with your nose for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 4 seconds, exhale with your mouth open for 4 seconds, and hold for 4 seconds. Repeat a few times and see how you feel afterwards!"

I don’t have a lot of experience with worrying about human things, but occasionally I do worry about if I will be having tuna today or just the regular. When I feel there are a lot of thoughts flooding through my head like a ball of yarn, I find it useful to try to slow things down.",

    "remark": "Mmmmm… this is something that is very foreign to me, since that is what I do for the majority of the day. Is there something that is really stressful going on in your life? I am sorry that you are having this kind of problem. I really can’t imagine how life would be like if we can’t relax. Other cats have told me how when they can’t relax, they sometimes end up drowning themselves in front of the television or watching cat videos on the internet, but they told me that it didn’t really make them feel relaxed afterwards.",
